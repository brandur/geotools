h1. Geotools.Net

This is a mirror of Urban Science's Geotools.Net project, mainly created to clean-up the source files and tests, and to upgrade it to run with modern versions of Visual Studio.

The code is copyright Urban Science Applications, Inc., written by Ronda Bergman, Andrew Coats, and Linda Koeppe; and tested by Keith McLeod. It is licensed under the GPL version 2.1.

h2. Description

(Copied from "http://geotoolsnet.sourceforge.net/Index.html":http://geotoolsnet.sourceforge.net/Index.html)

Geotools.Net is a set of .net class useful when handling geographic information. The project started as port from Java to C# of JTS 1.2. It implements the following  OpenGIS specifications:

    * Simple Features specification.
    * Coordinate Transformation Services

Other features include:

    * ability to read and write well-known-binary
    * ability to export features to SVG
    * ESRI shapefile import and export

h2. Changes

    * I've left out the Geotools.SystemTests project because it doesn't compile and I have no idea what the authors were intending to do there. It's still available from the original project's CVS.
    * A couple minor changes to the DBF reader:
        ** '\0' characters are now trimmed from the end of character records
        ** Null date types are now handled correctly (read as 8 blank characters)
        ** @DbaseFieldDescriptor@ now has a @ToString()@ override to make debugging easier
    * Testing related changes:
        ** The Geotools project's internals are now visible to Geotools.UnitTests, so I've uncommented a set of tests that were commented out before because their targets had been made internal
        ** Added NUnit's @[Test]@ attribute to all unit tests so that my test runners can find them
        ** Changed one assertion method so that it doesn't differentiate between Windows line endings (@\r\n@) and Unix line endings (@\n@) when comparing strings

h2. @todo

    * Modernize or replace the NAnt *.build files, so far I haven't tested them at all
    * The JTS binary that comes with this code is version 1.6, it may or may not be advantageous to upgrade to 1.8
    * The unit test project contains a lot of constructor tests, I might get rid of these if they end up being more trouble maintaining than they're worth
    * More testing in general is probably in order
